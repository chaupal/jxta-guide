The project supports the following goals:   <ol>   <li>A significant percentage of traffic on the JXTA 'discuss' and 'user' lists is generated by JXTA beginners who are experiencing problems getting their initial demo applications running. Replies with additional explanations and suggestions on how to solve these problems are usually placed on the lists but there is currently no mechanism for accumulating these suggestions in one place so that they can eventually be integrated into the guide. This project provides a place to accumulate suggestions like this.</li>      <li>The project provides the resources needed to place the guide under version control which will have a number of benefits. One benefit is that it will allow enhancements to be added to the guide on a regular basis in order to better serve beginning JXTA developers. A second benefit is that it will allow the JXTA core developers to update various sections of the guide on a continuous basis so that it matches the changes or additions to the reference platform. A third benefit is that anyone who is interested in using the latest CVS snapshot of the reference platform will benefit from also being able to use the latest snapshot of the guide ( which should be in sync with it ).</li>      <li>An email list for the guide's maintainers has been created in the project (<a href="mailto:dev@jxta-guide.dev.java.net">JXTA Guide Dev</a>) and all issues related to guide planning and maintenance are conducted on this list.</li>   </ol>
